✅ 1. Understand the Context (Optional but Crucial) \* What is the data about?

    * Why was it extracted?

    * Who will use it (Data Scientists, Analysts, BI tools)?

🔍 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) \* Even as a Data Engineer (not just a Data Scientist), you need to peek at the data.

    * Check row/column counts

    * Look at data types

    * Preview data (head(), sample() in pandas)

    * Understand column meanings (use data dictionary if available)

🚦 3. Data Quality Checks \* Catch problems before they become disasters later.

    * Missing Values: How many? Which columns?

    * Duplicates: Are there duplicates? Should they be removed?

    * Ranges/Boundaries: Are there outliers or invalid values (e.g., negative ages)?

    * Data Types: Correct format? (e.g., dates as datetime, not strings)

    * Referential Integrity: IDs matching between related datasets?

🧹 4. Data Cleaning \* Now fix the stuff you found above.

    * Handle nulls (fill, drop, impute)

    * Fix types (convert string to int/float/date)

    * Remove or label duplicates

    * Normalize data (standardize column names, formats)

    * Remove obvious outliers or investigate them

🛠️ 5. Data Transformation \* Get it into a usable structure.

    * Rename columns, map values (e.g., 0 → "Male", 1 → "Female")

    * Create calculated columns (e.g., age from birth date)

    * Merge or join other datasets

    * Pivoting/unpivoting (wide ↔ long)

    * Apply business logic or rules

📦 6. Data Validation
_ Check that the transformations make sense.
_
_ Compare row counts (before vs. after)
_
_ Re-check aggregates (sums, means)
_
_ Spot-check samples
_ \* Create validation rules (like unit tests for data)

🧾 7. Documentation & Metadata
_ Always leave breadcrumbs.
_
_ Document the source
_
_ Note any assumptions made
_
_ Store schema, data types, transformation steps
_
_ If possible, automate documentation
_
🗃️ 8. Load or Deliver Cleaned Data
_ Once it’s ready:
_
_ Load to a data warehouse or lake (BigQuery, Snowflake, S3, etc.)
_
_ Deliver to downstream systems or analytics teams
_ \* Save intermediate files if needed (CSV, Parquet, etc.)

🔄 9. Automate & Monitor
You’ll likely have to do this regularly.

Build a pipeline (Airflow, dbt, Luigi, etc.)

Add logging and error handling

Set up alerts for data anomalies
